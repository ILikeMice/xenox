# May 22nd: Basic structure design

Spent a bunch of time in fusion trying to figure out little details but ended up with a design for the component enclosure that im pretty happy with, attached below, making the screw holes next to the block (supposed to be the PSU) align with the edge of the psu so i can actually take it out was pretty painful, gonna have a hole there and thinking about maybe? adding rails to be able to kinda slide everything out for maintenance.

Also got info on what fuse i need for the psu iec socket (confusing but shoutout @Volkov08 for helping)

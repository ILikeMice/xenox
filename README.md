# Xenox - An AI powered arm assistant featuring vision (and maybe voice control!)

My idea is to make an assistant that can help me hold some parts or a fan when soldering, and do other tasks like give basic info/research with voice input, see plan below!

## Plan / Ideas
- Make the arm have 6 axis
- Claw with 3 (?) fingers
- Camera in the middle of the claw
- Microphone & Speaker for Voice control
    - AI Model self-made/Some open-sourced one
- Make an idle/sleep pose where the arm folds into itself (My desk is lowkey small)
